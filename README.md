# gold_predictions
Project comparing predictions of gold prices using a random forest and  xgboost regressors. Both made use of the cuda extensions for GPU enhanced model training. 

Random Forest metrics:

    MAE: 7.650239453124995
  
    R² score on test data: 0.9758996372625109


XGBoost metrics:

    MAE: 9.930712369791655
  
    R² score on test data: 0.9653308709742245



pkl file for the random forest model is included if you want to integrate this model for predicting the price of gold on your own
